# Rubinius WebAssembly

A WebAssembly implementation of the Rubinius instruction set.

The Rubinius instruction set is intended to be a rich, semantically complete set of operations that enables encoding all relevant language semantics to provide analysis and optimization without needing to recreate type information.

By implementing the Rubinius instructions set directly in WebAssembly, all the Rubinius tools, including compiler toolchain and language analysis tools, are immediately available on any conforming WebAssembly platform.
